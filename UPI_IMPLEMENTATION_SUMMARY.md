## 🚀 How to Use

### Backend Setup
1. Ensure `.env` has your UPI details:
   ```
   GYM_UPI_ID=your-upi-id@bank
   GYM_NAME=Your Gym Name
   ```

2. Server will automatically create `uploads/payment-screenshots/` directory

3. Routes are ready at `/api/payment/upi/*`

### Frontend Integration
1. Use the demo HTML as reference: `upi-payment-demo.html`
2. Or integrate the API calls into your existing frontend
3. Generate UPI deep links using the format in documentation
4. Implement transaction submission form
5. Add payment status polling

### Admin Panel
1. Add section to view pending payments
2. Display payment details and screenshot
3. Add approve/reject buttons
4. Show verification history

## 📊 Payment States

- `created` - Initial order created
- `verification_pending` - User submitted details, awaiting admin
- `paid` - Admin verified payment
- `failed` - Admin rejected payment

## 🧪 Testing

1. Start your server
2. Open `upi-payment-demo.html` in browser
3. Submit fake transaction details
4. Check database - payment should be "verification_pending"
5. Use admin endpoint to verify
6. Check status again - should be "paid"

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Create UI to manage pending payments
2. **Email Notifications**: Notify users about verification status
3. **Auto-verification**: Integrate with bank statement API for automatic verification
4. **Analytics**: Track payment success rates
5. **Refunds**: Add refund handling for rejected payments

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is a manual payment system requiring admin verification
- Not suitable for high-volume automated transactions
- Best for small to medium businesses
- Consider automated reconciliation for scale
- Always cross-check transaction IDs with your bank statement

## 🔧 Configuration

Update your UPI details in `.env`:
```env
GYM_UPI_ID=zenithgym@paytm    # Your UPI ID
GYM_NAME=Pie Fitness      # Your business name
```
